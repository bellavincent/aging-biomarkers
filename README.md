# Aging Biomarkers
SDS 322E Project: Aging Biomarkers

Part 1. Exploratory analysis. In this part, first, you visualize the data set. Then, use your visualizations to generate a few hypotheses (3-5 hypotheses). We are not going to perform hypothesis testing in this class. In more advanced courses, you learn how to perform hypothesis testing. 
 
Part 2. Predictive Task. It can be a classification task or a regression task. Pick a target variable and use the other variables in your dataset to train and test a predictive model. Then assess the performance of your predictive model using the techniques that will be discussed in class.
